//This file will containt swift 3 examples for the basics of the language. In order to achieve the complete learning of the language you should practice in the order.

//TYPES
//Int, Float, Double, Bool, String, Character, YourOwnType
//Float less decimal
//Double more decimal
//use UpperCamelCase

//Tuples
//recommend use: send and receive multiple data from a function

//IF statement
//cmd+[ or ] for identation


//loops

//continue----->next item in loop
//break ------->leave loop

//Ones the case is match the control flow will continue and ignore the other cases
//for a fallthrough escenario use the kayword fallthrough
